## 1. Introduction

**Game Title:** DarkNet (working title)
**Genre:** 2D Multiplayer Hacking Simulation
**Platforms:** Web (modern browsers)
**Target Audience:** Cybersecurity enthusiasts, tech-savvy gamers, CTF competitors

**Vision:**

## 2. High-Level Concept

* **What You Do:**

  * Hack other players, NPC companies, and government servers
  * Craft and sell zero-day exploits in a decentralized black market
  * Build reputation (and infamy) through clean hacks, CTF wins, and bounty missions

* **Why It’s Unique:**

  * **Real tools & commands**: Nmap, SSH, custom SPL language
  * **Peer-to-peer network**: Direct WebRTC tunnels, STUN/TURN fallback
  * **Hybrid storage**: IndexedDB for local files, Firestore for critical data
  * **Dynamic world**: NPC defenders, weekly CTF events, evolving Tech & Econ

## 3. Story & Setting

* **Backdrop:**
  A near-future digital underworld where corporations and governments wage silent wars through hackers-for-hire.

* **Player Role:**
  Self-taught cyber mercenary. Start with modest gear; climb the ranks to join black-ops, influence markets, or even topple nations.

* **Progression:**

  * **Tier 1 (Script Kiddie):** Basic port scans, simple exploits
  * **Tier 2 (Operator):** Weaponize Python/JS/SPL, access restricted servers
  * **Tier 3 (Ghost):** Master stealth, chain relays, execute BGP hijacks
  * **Tier 4 (Legend):** Run zero-day marketplace, influence world economy

## 4. Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 4.1 Hacking Operations

* **JSON-RPC Commands** over DataChannel:

  * `scanPorts`, `bruteforceSSH`, `runExploit`, `uploadPayload`
* **Terminal Interface:**

  * Familiar Linux prompt, in-game Nmap & Wireshark
  * Script editor for JS, Python, SPL

### 4.2 File System

* **IndexedDB (Local):**

  * Store logs, scripts, temporary files
  * Ghost Mode: offline access & sync on reconnect
* **Firestore (Cloud):**

  * Backup critical assets: black market listings, mission briefs, mail attachments
  * Versioning and conflict resolution handled automatically

### 4.3 Network & Sessions

* **Signaling (WebSocket):**

  * Peer discovery and SDP/ICE exchange
* **WebRTC DataChannels:**

  * Encrypted, direct tunnels for each hack/chat
* **STUN/TURN:**

  * NAT traversal, onion-style relay chaining for stealth
* **Topology Modes:**

  * One-on-One, Full Mesh (small squads), Partial/Hybrid Mesh (CTF events)

### 4.4 Reputation & Economy

* **Trust Score:**

  * Based on stealthy hacks, CTF placements, marketplace honesty
* **Blockchain-Backed Transactions:**

  * Immutable records of zero-day sales, bounties
  * Smart contracts automate payouts
* **In-Game Currency:**

  * Crypto tokens earned & spent in black market, bribes, upgrades

### 4.5 NPCs & Events

* **Dynamic NPC Peers:**

  * Simulated servers with IDS/IPS modules
  * ML-driven defenses that adapt to player tactics
* **Weekly CTF Events:**

  * Temporary pub/sub channels for team coordination
  * Special rewards: rare exploits, reputation boosts
